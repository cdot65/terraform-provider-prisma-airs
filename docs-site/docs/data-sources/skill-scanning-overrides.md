# Skill Scanning Trusted skills

Returns one page in `result.skill_overrides`; use `limit`/`skip`. Typed filters narrow by skill name, fingerprint, and trusting identity. `q` is a broad search requiring at least three characters. This result is sensitive.

```hcl
data "prisma-airs_supply_chain_skill_scanning_overrides" "example" {
  limit = 50
}
```

Responses are native Terraform objects and tuples, not JSON strings: access fields directly without `jsondecode`. Optional fields may be omitted or null, following the SDK contract; use `try(...)` where appropriate. Page data sources retain API pagination metadata. Complete rule inventories return their own arrays without inventing global totals.

Skill Scanning belongs to **AI Supply Chain Security**. Configure both base URLs in `supply_chain`, using shared OAuth credentials. The Go SDK package name remains `aisec/agentguard`; Terraform names and guides use Skill Scanning.

```hcl
provider "prisma-airs" {
  supply_chain {
    skill_scanning_data_endpoint = "https://api.apps.paloaltonetworks.com/aiag/data"
    skill_scanning_mgmt_endpoint = "https://api.apps.paloaltonetworks.com/aiag/mgmt"
  }
}
```

Alternatively set `PANW_SKILL_SCANNING_DATA_ENDPOINT` and `PANW_SKILL_SCANNING_MGMT_ENDPOINT`. The established SDK variables `PANW_AGENT_GUARD_*_ENDPOINT` are fallback aliases. No endpoint is inferred from credentials.
